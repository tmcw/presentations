Mapbox Studio<notes>
I've been working on this stuff for a long time. I've worked on projects
that took off, and projects that never saw the light of day. At this
juncture, I'm working on Mapbox Studio
and Mapbox GL JS as much as I can, and am honestly very optimistic about the
next few years in mapping.

This would suggest that I should just talk about Mapbox Studio and GL JS
and how cool they are.

<div><strong>Flashy demos</strong>: 0<notes>
But I'm going to take a guess that you like your demos on your own computer
rather than a projector, and since you're here you aren't just shopping for
technology, you're building it. So apologies if you're completely unsold:
I'm not going to try.

<div><strong>Culling</strong>
<i>selecting from a large quantity;

<div><strong>See also</strong>
<i>search, caching, binning</i></div>

<div>The biggest improvement in map performance
is from what you choose <i>not to draw</i></div>

<div>Unnecessary features, unnecessary details,
every place in the world other than the

<div data-bodyclass='vintage'><span style='background:#fff;padding:0.5em;'>Let's begin</span></div>

<div><small>Phase 1</small>
<h2>UNTILED WMS</h2>
<i>Selection</i> by a bounding box &amp; dimensions.
Everything was generated from scratch.
<i>Nothing was reused.</i><notes>See http://dev.openlayers.org/examples/wms-untiled.html for
an example of this</notes>
</div>

&amp;WIDTH=768&amp;HEIGHT=384
</div>

<div><small>Phase 2</small>
<h2>Google-Style Tiles</h2>
<i>Selection</i> by tile coordinates.
Unlike coordinates, tiles are predictable.
Two users looking at Philadelphia <i>see the same tiles</i>.
<i>Tiles are reused and cached.</i><notes>These tiles are called XYZ tiles
nowadays, and OpenStreetMap has the best specification for them: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map
It's a folksy spec with no real governing body, but it's worked out pretty fine because it's
so simple.</notes>
</div>

<div>
<strong>Google-Style Tiles</strong>

</div>

<div>This was a big deal.
Without tiles, we would be nowhere.</div>

<div><small>Phase 2.5</small>
<h2>Tiles and Overlays</h2>
The era of Leaflet
- Tiled raster maps for complex base data
- Vectors atop in SVG, HTML, or Canvas

this is more or less right now<notes>The subtext is that we have vectors already,
and have had vector rendering in one form or another since the very early days
(fun fact that the earliest computer monitors were vector, and were super cool).
But the place where it sits in the mapping world is just short of "actually powering
a map": tech like SVG and Canvas is pretty neat but not good enough or fast
enough to render complex base maps.</notes>
</div>

<div>Enter stage right: Vector Tiles</div>

<div><quiet>Vector is an overloaded term</quiet>
there is vector data,
like GeoJSON or Shapefiles</div>

<div><quiet>Vector is an overloaded term</quiet>
there is vector rendering,
like SVG, Canvas, or PostScript</div>

<div data-bodyclass='tiger'><span style='background:#fff;padding:1em;'>Shoutout to PostScript</span><notes>
No, but seriously, PostScript is a true language nerd's language:
it's a turing-complete concatenative language that everyone just thinks
is for printers. It's hella cool
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript
</notes></div>

<div>Vector tiles are none of these things</div>

<div><strong>Vector tiles</strong>
<i>Non-visual, non-geographical efficient tiled data</i>
</div>

<div><strong>Non-visual</strong>
Unlike SVG, they don't have style.

They don't have color or width.
Only points, lines, and polygons.</div>

<div><strong>Non-visual</strong>
Unlike GeoJSON, they don't have coordinates.

Not latitude or longitude.
Only pixel offsets within tiles.<notes>The astute reader might
point out: but you can unproject those pixels back to geographical coordiantes.
Indeed you can! But that's not the driving intent of the format: vector
tiles are designed as a processed data representation, not a raw one.</notes></div>

<div><strong>Efficient</strong>
Vector tiles are designed for the whole map.
Not just an overlay.</div>

<div><strong>Efficient: Protocol Buffers</strong>
Binary encoding, plus numeric tricks like zig-zag
encodings, make vector tiles fast</div>

<div>but wait! non-geographic? non visual?
vector tiles are used for all kinds
of data usecases, as you'll see today.</div>

<div>you can unproject a vector tile and
get geographical data (albeit <em>quantized</em>)
back</div>

<div>raster tiles are
<em>facets of a gigantic image</em>

vector tiles are
<em>facets into a database</em></div>

<div>subtext:

<strong>databases are branded datastructures</strong></div>

<div>{Close loop}<notes>Okay, so I've given the thousand foot description of
vector tiles: let's return to the phases of mapping within this information
and see how it connects.</notes></div>

<div><small>Phase 2.75</small>
<h2>Vector-tile backed raster tiles</h2>
You see images in your browser that look like normal
image tiles, but behind the scenes they're rendered
from vector tiles on the fly.
</div>

<div>Mapbox did this for a year
Google did too
Huh?
Why?
</div>

<div>If you aren't using WebGL,
why go vector?
</div>

<div><strong>Culling</strong>
<i>selecting from a large quantity;
obtaining from a variety of sources</i><notes>Look at that:
closing the narrative loop.</div>

<div><h3>WMS</h3>
- cache nothing
</div>

<div><h3>Tiles</h3>
- cache output<notes>This caching really happens on lots of levels:
MBTiles at the first, and then memory caches like memcached on the server level,
and Cloudfront and Fastly at the CDN level, and finally in the browser.
Caches on caches.</notes>
</div>

<div><h3>Vector Tiles</h3>
- preprocess + cache <strong>input</strong>
</div>

<div data-bodyclass='osm-qa'><span style='background:#fff;padding:0.2em;border:1px solid #888;'>this is a big deal</span></div>

<div><strong>Drawing is fast</strong>
<strong>Mapbox GL JS or Mapnik</strong> can redraw
a map in milliseconds.
</div>

<div><strong>Culling</strong>
The milliseconds spent in map rendering are
centered around <strong>culling</strong>, not drawing.
</div>

<div><strong>Culling</strong>
- Querying PostGIS
- Network latency
- Feature simplification
</div>

<div>Vector tiles <em>split culling from drawing</em>
So drawing can be fast and culling can be cached
</div>

<div data-bodyclass='flights'><span style='background:#fff;padding:0.2em;'>Phase 3</span></div>

<div><small>Phase 3</small>
<h2>Vector</h2>
Vector tiles are visualized directly
in your browser.
</div>

<div>Effectively no caching of visual output
<em>because it's so fast to regenerate</em></div>

<div><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>
Vector tiles are efficiently encoded:
they're radically smaller than equivalent GeoJSON</div>

<div>But culling is so much more important</div>

<div>The OSM Planet is 29 gigabytes.

You typically see 0.00172% of it.<notes>Obviously fuzzy numbers, but this is roughly 400kb / 29gb</notes></div>

<div>In TileMill, to render a single tile,

- Mapnik connects to PostGIS
- Mapnik queries PostGIS for a bounding box
- PostGIS asks its R-Tree index for features
- PostGIS encodes those features into WKB, sends them to Mapnik
- Mapnik parses WKB into geometries in memory
- Mapnik reprojects geometries into screen coordinates
- Mapnik draws the tile</div>

<div>The parts are cached into vector tiles

<div><strong>TileMill</strong>
data to styled raster maps<notes>TileMill: remember that? That's a project
we did on a Knight News grant, a desktop tool for map creation. It was the reason
CartoCSS got built, and a real cool experience. It's still around as an open
source project.</notes></div>

<div><strong>Mapbox Studio Classic</strong>

<div><strong>Mapbox Studio</strong>
styles for vector maps
</div>

<div>  <strong>Everything changes</strong>
- floating-point zoom levels
- animated transitions
- low-level stylesheets
- resolution independence
</div>

<div>all because of vector tiles</div>

<div data-bodyclass='floating-point'><span style='background:#fff;padding:0.2em;'><strong>floating-point zoom levels</strong>
Because vector tiles can be losslessly transformed</span>
</div>

<div data-bodyclass='grayish'> <img src='zoom-stop.png' /></div>

<div data-bodyclass='transition'><span style='background:#000;color:#fff;padding:0.2em;'><strong>animated transitions</strong>
Because re-rendering maps is fast
</div>

<div><strong>resolution independence</strong>
Because the same vector &amp; fonts can be
rendered at any dpi, and we dynamically render
SVG sprites.</div>

<div data-bodyclass='introspection'><span style='background:#000;color:#fff;padding:0.2em;'><strong>data introspection</strong>
Because the data actually reaches your browser</div>
