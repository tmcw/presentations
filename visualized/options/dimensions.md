right now I'm leaning away from doing this talk at this conference

Geographic data, Maps, and the dimensions cruelly stolen from us

as bostock says, there are three available dimensions and position is the most
important - the x & y dimension.

maps are typically two-dimensional, since they're cruelly crushed from three
to two dimensions by what we call map projections. a true map would be acquired
by flying to space and peering back at your homeworld tearfully, but alas
that has a significant disadvantage to our crushed maps, namely that you can't
see the back of it.

which leaves us with two-dimensional space. and, in terms of visualization,
things in that two dimensional space. we tune out the things that are typically
always there, like water, so I'll tune those out too.

the curse of map visualization is that everything is infinitely close
to each other but has nothing to do with each other. in that everything on earth
has latitude and longitude and a place - it is, in current buzz shorthand,
location data.

in other terms, all of the location data in the world about every topic
is cruelly crushed into the same dimension. this happens with other things as
well, like fiat currency - that the us gdp is a quarter of the world gdp.
that's straightforward enough to type into wolfram alpha and get an answer.

but more than anything else location implies affect, and implies causation
to a viewer. because maps are abstract expressions, but amongst the least
abstract you can find in visualization - in all their contortions, dollar
bills never evoke the image of pie charts or lines, and visualizing amounts
of money as warehouses of crates of hundred-dollar bills to buy figher jets
is entertaining because our familarity ends when you get to a stack of bills.

whereas the world looks like a map and thus we think maps are true, and that
there is no dangerous line between a map of a room and a map of a world that
makes one not quite the same thing as the other. and even in the space
between these things, we're slowly fooling ourselves into believing the
map over the reality, like we think of ads of mcdonald's burgers when eating
the approximate immediate thing.

so maps are special because we find it easy to trust them.

the problem with maps from the standpoint of visualization is that, from
a visualization standpoint, they steal the best dimensions from the very
beginning. maps are the space dimension, and we has visual designers are expected
to go from there.

and that's a risky gamble. a diehard believer in space as representative would
use a cartogram, which bloats and starves areas of the map to show different
values. but along this path lies the biggest risk - the loss of familiarity.

to be clear, this is one of the true pivots of visualization design. while
visualizations are currently famous for being new, for showing things
that have never before been drawn, beyond their artistic value the main
task is to inform. and to inform we have to imform humans, and in this case
familiarity and clarity are the only two values that matter.

familiarity can be just the husk of the familiar - the famous apple address
book rendered in faux leather that gives new users the instant feeling that
perhaps they already know how to use it. but it must be there; when we
understand new things, we understand them as building on previous knowledge.

when we look at a new map, our familiarity and expectations are layered over it
and can grant or void understanding.

and so, the most interesting maps are also the most difficult for the viewer.
