<div>the DC Code</div>
<div>how it got done</div>
<div>first why</div>
<div>i ride my bike</div>
<div><img src='bike.jpg' /> i ride my bike</div>
<div>there's an illegal valet service on 14th street</div>
<div class='invert'><img src='valet.jpeg' /> there's an illegal valet service on 14th street</div>
<div>not cool! let's fix this</div>
<div>let's link to the law</div>

<div>Before last month <em>YOU COULD NOT LINK TO ANY DC LAW</em></div>
<div><em>YOU COULD NOT LINK TO ANY DC LAW</em></div>
<div><em>YOU COULD NOT CITE THE DC LAW WITH A HYPERLINK</em></div>
<div><em>HYPERLINKS MATTER AND THE LAW MATTERS</em></div>

<div>DC</div>
<div>Code?</div>
<div><img src='lexis.png' /></div>

<div class='prose'>In law, codification is the process of collecting and restating the law of a jurisdiction in certain areas, usually by subject, forming a legal code, i.e. a codex (book) of law.</div>
<div class='prose'>The <em>Capitalsaurus</em> shall be the <em>official Dinosaur</em> of the District of Columbia. <em>ยง1-161j</em></div>
<div class='prose'>It shall not be lawful for any person or persons to play the game of <em>football</em>, or any other game with a ball, in any of the streets, avenues, or alleys in the City of Washington; nor shall it be lawful for any person or persons to play the game of bandy, shindy, or any other game by which a ball, stone, or other substance is struck or propelled by any stick, cane, or other substance in any street, avenue, or alley in the City of Washington, under a penalty of not more than $5 for each and every such offense. <em>ยง22-1308</em></div>
<div class='prose'>A person who commits first degree murder that constitutes <em>an act of terrorism</em> shall, upon conviction, be punished by <em>imprisonment for life</em> without the possibility of release. <em>ยง 22-3153</em></div>

<div>Before last month <em>YOU COULD NOT LINK TO ANY DC LAW</em></div>
<div>So the code is the law</div>
<div>Freeing?</div>

<div>Laws are open<em>*</em></div>
<div>Laws are open: copyright compendium, case law, standard practice</div>
<div>Laws are open: <em>everyone can agree, right?</em></div>

<div>the DC Law Was unlinkable</div>
<div>the DC Law Was illegal to download <em>(this would stand up in court)</em></div>
<div>the DC Law had &copy; registered by the DC Government <em>(this wouldn't)</em></div>

<div>Laws are open: <em>so how was this one closed and how did it get to be that way?</em></div>
<div><em>Open means ownership</em></div>
<div>Portals != open</div>

<div class='prose'>The <em>Code</em> is Codified <em>Bills</em></div>
<div class='prose'>DC's Council drafts &amp; passes laws as <em>bills</em></div>
<div class='prose'>DC's Council posts bills to a <em>portal</em></div>
<div class='prose'><em>LexisNexis</em> downloads bills and compiles them into the 'official code'</div>
<div class='prose'>LexisNexis has <em>the only complete digital copy of the official code</em></div>
<div class='prose'>(let's get that copy)</div>
<div class='prose'>No</div>
<div class='prose'>Terms of Service</div>
<div class='prose'>Copyright Infection</div>
<div class='prose'>nongovernment, so <em>no FOIA</em></div>

<div>so</div>
<div>what next?</div>
<div>(this is the part that took <em>from september to april</em>)</div>
<div class='wp'>1. Understanding</div>
<div><img src='bills.jpg' /></div>
<div><img src='cd.jpg' /></div>
<div><img src='structure.jpg' /></div>
<div class='wp'>2. Finding the opening</div>
<div>CONTRACTS RULE EVERYTHING</div>
<div>no really</div>
<div>CONTRACTS RULE EVERYTHING</div>
<div><em>FOIA</em> Contract with WestLaw &rarr;</div>
<div> <img src='contract.png' /></div>
<div>'Computer tapes' = email of <em>Word Documents</em></div>
<div><em>Word Documents</em> = gross?</div>
<div><em>Word Documents</em> = <em>don't care</em></div>
<div>Word Documents were <em>copyright infected</em> and it took a day to remove the logos</div>
<div>(thanks Josh Tauberer &amp; V David Zvenyach)</div>
<div>so</div>
<div>Word Documents!</div>
<div>what's next?</div>
<div class='wp'>step one: a better browser</div>
<div><img src='browser.png' /></div>
<div>open source &amp; simple</div>
<div><em>simple</em> means simple. worry about the problem at hand: putting laws on the internet. do not overarchitect. <em>build fast.</em></div>
<div>in short, <em>be dumb</em></div>
<div>thousands of laws = thousands of JSON files</div>
<div>why?</div>
<div><em>almost free to host</em></div>
<div>it's <em>easy</em> to build a better portal than <em>lexis</em></div>
<div>it's <em>easy</em> to do a better job than lexis</div>
<div>it's <em>cheap</em> to do a better job than lexis</div>
<div class='wp'>step two: create with the code</div>
<div><img src='dates.png' /></div>
<div>code &rarr; LaTeX &rarr; <code>thelaw.pdf</code></div>
<div>code &rarr; the code on an iphone</div>
<div>code &rarr; search</div>
<div class='wp'>step three: sustainable?</div>
<div><em>contractors aren't sustainable</em></div>
<div><em>west</em> &rarr; <em>lexis</em></div>
<div>took <em>over four months to transition</em></div>
<div><em>could have lost data</em></div>
<div>on the other hand</div>
<div>open source</div>
<div>belongs to nobody.<br />is passed down.<br />regenerates by rewriting.<br />cares about data.</div>
<div>and makes lots of copies <em>because that's the right way to do data</em>.</div>
<div>finally we can make copies of this open data, and do more with it.</div>
<div>want a copy?</div>
